3. Technical Implementation
3.1 Game Board Architecture
The game board is the foundation of the Cluedo implementation, requiring careful consideration of spatial relationships and movement mechanics. Our implementation uses a coordinate-based system combined with room connectivity to create an accurate representation of the classic Cluedo mansion.
Board Coordinate System
We implement the game board using a 3x6 grid system, where each position is represented by x and y coordinates:
@dataclass class Position:
x: int y: int
def __eq__(self, other):
if not isinstance(other, Position):
return False
return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y
The Position class uses Python's dataclass decorator to automatically implement comparison and initialization methods. This choice simplifies position handling while maintaining clear code structure. The coordinates work as follows:
● x-axis (0-2): Represents columns across the board
● y-axis (0-5): Represents rows from top to bottom
● Each room occupies multiple positions on this grid
Room Implementation
Rooms are implemented as complex objects that manage their positions, connections, and entry points:
class Room:
def __init__(self, name: str, positions: List[Position]):
self.name = name self.positions = positions self.connected_rooms = [] self.entry_points = positions

 def add_connection(self, room: 'Room'): if room not in self.connected_rooms:
self.connected_rooms.append(room) room.connected_rooms.append(self)
This implementation provides several key features:
1. Room Positioning: Each room maintains a list of positions it occupies on the board. For example, the Kitchen might occupy positions (0,0) and (0,1). This allows for:
○ Accurate room size representation
○ Proper collision detection
○ Valid movement checking
2. Room Connections: The connected_rooms list maintains the valid pathways between rooms. When initializing the game, we establish these connections:
def _initialize_rooms(self) -> Dict[str, Room]: room_positions = {
"Kitchen": [Position(0, 0), Position(0, 1)], "Ballroom": [Position(1, 0), Position(1, 1)], # ... other rooms ...
}
rooms = {name: Room(name, positions)
for name, positions in room_positions.items()}
    # Define room connections
connections = [
("Kitchen", "Ballroom"), ("Ballroom", "Conservatory"), # ... other connections ...
]
for room1_name, room2_name in connections: rooms[room1_name].add_connection(rooms[room2_name])
return rooms
3.2 Character Movement System
The character movement system integrates position tracking with room awareness to create a realistic movement mechanic:
Movement Validation
Before any movement occurs, the system validates potential moves:
def get_valid_moves(self, game: 'CluedoGame') -> List[Tuple[Position, Optional[Room]]]:

 valid_moves = []
current_pos = self.character.position
    # Check room-to-room movement
if self.character.current_room: for connected_room in
self.character.current_room.connected_rooms:
for entry_point in connected_room.entry_points:
valid_moves.append((entry_point, connected_room))
    # Check adjacent squares
for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]: new_x = current_pos.x + dx
new_y = current_pos.y + dy
if 0 <= new_x <= 2 and 0 <= new_y <= 5:
new_pos = Position(new_x, new_y)
            # Check if new position is in a room
room = None
for game_room in game.rooms.values():
if new_pos in game_room.positions: room = game_room
break valid_moves.append((new_pos, room))
return valid_moves
This movement validation system ensures:
1. Legal Movement:
○ Players can only move to adjacent squares
○ Room-to-room movement follows connected pathways
○ No movement outside board boundaries
○ No overlap with other players
2. Room Entry/Exit:
○ Characters can enter rooms through valid entry points
○ Movement between connected rooms is allowed
○ Proper updating of character's room status
The movement execution is handled through the Player class:
python
Copy
def make_move(self, game: 'CluedoGame'):
valid_moves = self.get_valid_moves(game)
if self.is_human: print("\nAvailable moves:")
for i, (pos, room) in enumerate(valid_moves):
location = f"Room: {room.name}" if room else f"Position: ({pos.x}, {pos.y})"

 print(f"{i+1}. Move to {location}")
choice = int(get_user_input(
"Choose your move (enter number):", [str(i+1) for i in range(len(valid_moves))]
)) - 1
new_pos, new_room = valid_moves[choice] else:
        # AI player makes random valid move
new_pos, new_room = random.choice(valid_moves)
self.character.move_to(new_pos, new_room) return new_room
3.3 Card Management System
The card system forms the core of Cluedo's deduction mechanics, requiring careful implementation to maintain game integrity and enable proper information tracking.
Card Implementation
Each card in the game is represented by the Card class:
class Card:
def __init__(self, name: str, card_type: str):
self.name = name
self.card_type = card_type # 'character', 'weapon', or 'room'
def __str__(self):
return f"{self.name} ({self.card_type})"
The card distribution system handles the initial game setup:
def _setup_cards_and_players(self, num_human_players: int):
    # Create all possible cards
character_cards = [Card(char.name, 'character') for char in self.characters]
weapon_cards = [Card(weapon.name, 'weapon') for weapon in self.weapons]
room_cards = [Card(room.name, 'room') for room in self.rooms.values()]
    # Remove solution cards from distribution pool

 all_cards = character_cards + weapon_cards + room_cards solution_cards = [
card for card in all_cards
if card.name in [self.solution[0].name,
self.solution[1].name, self.solution[2].name]
]
for card in solution_cards:
all_cards.remove(card)
    # Distribute remaining cards evenly
random.shuffle(all_cards)
for i, card in enumerate(all_cards):
player_index = i % len(self.players)
self.players[player_index].add_card(card)
system ensures:
1. Fair distribution of cards among players
2. Proper removal of solution cards
3. Random distribution of remaining cards
4. Equal number of cards per player (when possible)
3.4 Suggestion and Accusation System
The suggestion and accusation mechanics are central to gameplay, allowing players to gather information and attempt to solve the mystery.
Suggestion Implementation
The suggestion system allows players to propose a potential solution and receive feedback:
def handle_suggestion(self, suggesting_player: Player, suggestion: Tuple[str, str, str]) ->
Optional[Card]:
"""Process a suggestion and handle refutations""" if suggesting_player.is_human:
print(f"\n{suggesting_player.character.name} suggests:") print(f"Murderer: {suggestion[0]}")
print(f"Weapon: {suggestion[1]}")
print(f"Room: {suggestion[2]}")
    # Check each player in clockwise order
start_idx = (self.players.index(suggesting_player) + 1) % len(self.players)
current_idx = start_idx
while current_idx != self.players.index(suggesting_player):

 player = self.players[current_idx] if not player.is_eliminated:
refutation = player.can_refute(suggestion) if refutation:
if suggesting_player.is_human: print(f"\n{player.character.name} refuted with
{refutation}")
return refutation
current_idx = (current_idx + 1) % len(self.players)
return none
The suggestion process involves:
1. Player makes a suggestion when in a room
2. System checks each other player in order
3. First player able to refute must do so
4. Information is recorded in player's notes
Accusation System
The accusation system determines game outcomes:
def handle_accusation(self, player: Player,
accusation: Tuple[str, str, str]) -> bool:
"""Process a player's accusation and determine if they won""" correct_accusation = (
accusation[0] == self.solution[0].name and accusation[1] == self.solution[1].name and accusation[2] == self.solution[2].name
)
if correct_accusation: self.game_over = True self.winner = player return True
else:
player.is_eliminated = True
# Check if only one player remains
active_players = [p for p in self.players if not
p.is_eliminated]
if len(active_players) == 1:
self.game_over = True
self.winner = active_players[0] return False
Key aspects of the accusation system:

 1. Players can make accusations at any time
2. Incorrect accusations eliminate the player
3. Correct accusation immediately wins the game
4. Game ends if only one player remains
3.5 Player Note System
The note-taking system helps players track information:
class Player:
def __init__(self, character: Character, is_human: bool =
False):
self.character = character
self.cards: List[Card] = [] self.notes: Set[str] = set() self.is_eliminated = False self.is_human = is_human
def add_note(self, note: str): self.notes.add(note)
def print_notes(self): if self.notes:
print("\nYour Notes:")
for note in sorted(self.notes):
print(f"- {note}")
The note system records:
1. Suggestions made and their outcomes
2. Cards shown during refutations
3. Rooms visited
4. Eliminated possibilities
3.6 User Interface and Game Flow
The game implements a text-based interface that prioritizes clarity and usability:
def clear_screen():
"""Clear the console screen"""
os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
def print_heading(text: str): """Print a formatted heading""" print("\n" + "=" * 50)

 print(text.center(50)) print("=" * 50 + "\n")
The main game loop manages the flow of play:
def main(): clear_screen()
print_heading("Welcome to Cluedo!")
    # Game initialization
num_players = int(get_user_input( "How many human players? (1-6):", ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"]
))
game = CluedoGame(num_human_players=num_players)
    # Main game loop
round_number = 1
while not game.game_over and round_number <= 20:
clear_screen()
print_heading(f"Round {round_number}")
for player in game.players:
if not player.is_eliminated:
                # Handle player turn
handle_player_turn(game, player)
if game.game_over: Break
round_number += 1
